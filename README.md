# Salary Calculator

## Description

Duration: 3 days

I created an application that records employee salaries and calculates monthly salary costs for the company. 

To accomplish this, I first created funcionality to take in user input information for an employee and add that information to the DOM as a row in a table. I then added functionality to take in all employee salaries and calculate the total monthly cost for the company. If the total monthly cost exceeds $20,000, a red background color is displayed. Lastly, I created functionality to delete an employee from the table and deduct that employee's salary from the total monthly cost.
